    "question": "What is the primary purpose of prompt engineering in NLP?",
    "options": {
      "A": "To guide the AI model in producing the expected output.",
      "B": "To analyze existing data for patterns.",
      "C": "To classify data into predefined categories.",
      "D": "To create visual content without text."
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The primary purpose of prompt engineering is to guide the AI model to perform specific tasks by providing clear and detailed instructions."

    "question": "Which of the following best describes Few-Shot Prompting?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Providing no examples to the model.",
      "B": "Offering a single example to guide the model.",
      "C": "Giving multiple examples to enhance task performance.",
      "D": "Encouraging the model to reason through a series of steps."
    },

    "question": "Why is it important to avoid open-ended questions in prompt engineering?",
    "options": {
      "A": "They can lead to overly specific answers.",
      "B": "They may result in imprecise answers.",
      "C": "They are too complex for AI models.",
      "D": "They require too much context."
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Open-ended questions can lead to ambiguity and imprecise answers, making it essential to use clear and concise prompts."

    "id": 4,
    "question": "How does Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enhance AI performance?",
    "options": {
      "A": "By providing no context for the task.",
      "B": "By encouraging reasoning through a series of steps.",
      "C": "By limiting the model's ability to generate new content.",
      "D": "By focusing solely on classification tasks."
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enhances AI performance by encouraging the model to reason through a series of steps, which is particularly useful for complex tasks."
